<h2><p>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.</p></h2>

<h3><i>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.</i></h3>
<h4>
HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations.</h4>

<h5>Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas.
</h5>

<h6><u> To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as New attributes are introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed, and others  have been changed, redefined, or standardized.</h6>
